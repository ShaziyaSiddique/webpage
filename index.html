        <p>Google Chrome browser is a free web browser used for accessing the internet and running web-based applications. The Google Chrome browser is based on the Open Source Chromium web browser project. Google released Chrome in 2008 and issues several updates a year.

            Google Chrome is available for Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS and Linux desktop operating systems (OSes), as well as the Android and iOS mobile operating systems. Google Chrome is the default browser for Google devices including Android phones and Chromebook laptops. It is the most used web browser, with 66% of the market as of November 2022, according to StatCounter.
            Google Chrome is part of Google services, Google's family of products that includes Gmail, Google Maps and the Chrome search engine. Many of Google services are hosted on Chrome, which was one of the first internet browsers to use the cloud to support applications such as Google Docs, Google's popular word processor.</p>
        <h2 id="History">Google Chrome development history</h2>
        <P>Chrome was one the first major web browsers to combine the search box and address bar, known as the Omnibar, a feature that most competitors have since adopted. Users can sign in with their Google accounts, letting them sync bookmarks and webpages across multiple devices and access other Google products such as Google Drive.

            <P>The Google Chrome browser takes a sandboxing-based approach to web security. Each open website runs as its own process, which helps prevent malicious code on one page from affecting others or the computer OS itself. The browser supports web standards such as HTML5 and cascading style sheets.
            </P>
